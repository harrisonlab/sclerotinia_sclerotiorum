#Gene prediction using Braker

##Gene prediction is trained using RNA-Seq data 



##Downloading data 
### From ncbi
Data used for this test analysis SRA code: SRR1915981 was downloaded using fastq-dump

```bash
mkdir -p raw_rna/external/S_sclerotiorum_test_RNA_data
fastq-dump -O raw_rna/external/S_sclerotiorum_test_RNA_data SRR1915981
```

### From my computer
Example shows fasta files moved from RNA-Seq_T42 Rep_3 on my computer to RNA_Seq/Rep_3 on east malling server.

1. Change fasta file permissions
```bash
cd /Desktop/RNA-Seq_T42/Rep_3
chmod ugo+r WTCHG_*.fastq.gz
chmod ug+w  WTCHG_*.fastq.gz
```

2. Copy to east malling server
```bash
scp WTCHG_*.fastq.gz ransoe@149.155.34.72:/home/groups/harrisonlab/project_files/Sclerotinia_spp/RNA_Seq/Rep_3
```
